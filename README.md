# Sensory Game App

05/06/2023 - Work In Progress

## Note from the creator

As a neurodivergent person, I find structure, patterns and repetitive action grounding. This app is my, simplified, take on sensory apps that allows the user to engage with calming colours and music.

This is an are of passion for me and there will be future iterations. For now, this project is a way for me to express myself, my love for accessibility as well as my passion for tech.
