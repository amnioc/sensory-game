## Note from the creator

As a neurodivergent person, I find patterns can be very grounding. This app is my, simplified, take on sensory apps that allows the user to engage with repetitive sounds and patterns.

This is an area of passion for me and there will be ongoing features added. For now, this project is a way for me to express myself, my passion for accessibility and coding skills.

Technologies and Skills used:

React Framework (Hooks)
Typescript
HTML5
CSS Modules

Jest - unit and integration testing 
React Testing

Excalidraw - wireframes &
Kanban (Trello) - track tasks
